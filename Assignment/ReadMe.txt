In my program I have only used a main class and a control class, In my main I have everything to do with the programs functionality 
and the control class only starts the GUI. the functionality of my program is to be able to choose a specific word and be able to 
search through many different files to see which file has the most of that specific word and the strength of the files compared to each other.
If I had more time to improve on my program, it would have had the ability to search multiple words in succession and would be able to spell 
check each word. I spent a lot of time tweaking the GUI to make it more unique and user-friendly and am happy with the result.
